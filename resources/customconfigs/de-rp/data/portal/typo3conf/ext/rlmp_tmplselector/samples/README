rlmp_templselector/sample

This directory contains two .t3d files containing sample typoscript
templates for both ways of using the template selector.

Just copy one or both of the files into your fileadmin folder,
select a sysfolder or page in the backend and choose "import".

The templates are commented and you should (almost) easily understand
them after reading the manual of this extension.

Have fun!
