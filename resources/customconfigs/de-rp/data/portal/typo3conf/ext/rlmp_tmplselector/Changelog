1.2.3 - 28.11.2006
		Bugfix: When creating a new page, the templates can't be selected because no page uid exists yet. Thanks to Michael Fritz for the fix.
		Added Changelog
		
... Some versions in between ...

1.1.7 - Added the long awaited new minor features: You may now define the default filename / object number for main and subtemplates independently. Template selections may be inherited by pages deeper in the page tree (must be enabled, see reference). Provided two example sys_templates (see samples/ folder).
1.1.5 - Bugfix: Weird that nobody sent me a complaint about this: In HTML-file mode the setting for the default template file didn't have any effect! Because I used the TS mode, I didn't realize that ... Fixed now.
1.1.3 - 1.1.4 - Merged new languages
1.1.2 - Bugfix: Setting templatePathMain and templatePathSub remained without any effect. Fixed that. Included the recent translations into this package.
1.1.0 - now supports TS-only templates. The path configuration has been moved from the ExtensionManager to TypoScript.
1.0.3 - bug fix: automatic detection of html templates didn't work at all!
1.0.2 - published as a public extension with some minor changes
0.0.0 - first published by Kasper Skårhøj as part of the Modern Template Building tutorial
